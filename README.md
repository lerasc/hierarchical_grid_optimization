We provide a method to find the minimum of a function via brute force grid search. The grid can be refined hierarchically, meaning that the grid can be refined around the local minimum for multiple steps. This allows one to pinpoint the location of the minimum more precisely. The method handles multi-dimensional optimization problems and also allows for log-spaced grids and parallelization. See documentation inside 'grid_optimization.py' for details and examples.
